      True yoga is not about the shape of your body, but the shape of your life.
      Yoga is not to be performed; yoga is to be lived. Yoga doesnâ€™t care about
      what you have been; yoga cares about the person you are becoming. Yoga is
      designed for a vast and profound purpose, and for it to be truly called
      yoga, its essence must be embodied.
